TODO - Interpreter 3:

Pretty much everything to do with functions that aren't named main
  - M-state/M-value for functions
  - getting function calls to actually work
  - binding function parameter lists to their values 
  - function that gets a functions environment (still somewhat confused on what he means by this)
  - handling recursion
  	- functions within functions (related)
 

-In progress:
	-interpreting functions
		-interpreting functions should work identically to main, just with binding
		params now
		-how do function closures work? is there anything in place right now?

-Completed:
