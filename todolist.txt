TODO - Interpreter 3:

Pretty much everything to do with functions that aren't named main
  - M-state/M-value for functions
  - getting function calls to actually work
  - binding function parameter lists to their values 
  - function that gets a functions environment (still somewhat confused on what he means by this)
  - handling recursion
  - functions within functions
