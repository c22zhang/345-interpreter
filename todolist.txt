TODO:

Modify:

-M_state functions

Completed:
-store-variable-value-in-state should work hopefully maybe
-getVariableValue --follow this method for how to modify other methods
-contains-helper?(ok emacs search function sucks so i didnt realize it was already done and i'm too lazy to change whats already there)
-M-state functions should work with a return continuation i passed in -- not sure if it's completely tail recursive but probably more tail recursive then it was
-modifyVariableValue ->reads layers correctly
-add-value-to-variable (THIS MIGHT NEED TO BE MODIFIED LATER) ->should be fixed from store-variable-value-in-state
-modifyStateVals->worked by default
