TODO - Interpreter 4:
-new keyword doesn't work
-what to do with instance closures?

COMPLETE:
-class closures work
-instance closures currently just copy respective class closure
-run-main does call the correct class's main method
    -do note that any sort of messing with environment will most certainly
    break the way run-main and goToClass & generate-instance-closure work
    because they are currently just cadr-ing stuff
