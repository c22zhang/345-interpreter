TODO - Interpreter 4:
-new keyword doesn't work
-what to do with instance closures?
	-the problem is when you generate a new instance closure, the env
 	you pass in is the closure of the main class to be used, so it doesn't
	get the original environment and cant find the class closure to copy
COMPLETE:
-class closures work
-instance closures currently just copy respective class closure
-run-main does call the correct class's main method
    -do note that any sort of messing with environment will most certainly
    break the way run-main and goToClass & generate-instance-closure work
    because they are currently just cadr-ing stuff
